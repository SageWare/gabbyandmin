                <p class="card-text mbr-fonts-style mb-0 display-7">By downloading a mobile application for a Service ("App"), you are granted a non-commercial, non-exclusive, and revocable license by G&amp;M to use one (1) copy of the App for each Service on a single device that you own or control in connection with your account. This license covers all upgrades, modifications, enhancements, and related files and materials provided or available with the App. However, we cannot guarantee that the App will work correctly on your device or be compatible with it. You are strictly prohibited from creating copies of the App or altering, disassembling, decompiling, or reverse engineering the App, except as required by applicable law. If the App contains third-party software or intellectual property, such material is subject to the rights, title, and interest of the respective third parties, and any unauthorized use or copying is strictly forbidden and subject to the terms of the third party's end-user license agreement. All rights not granted in these terms are reserved by third parties. These terms are subject to change at G&amp;M's discretion.
<br>
<br>If you choose to use an Apple application as your App, you can only access and use it on an Apple iPhone OS device that you own or control. If you download the App and any associated mobile software from Apple’s iTunes Store or App Store ("App Store Version"), you agree to the following terms: These Terms are between you and G&amp;M, and not Apple. As such, Apple is not responsible for the App Store Version or its content, and is not required to provide any support services for it. If the App Store Version does not meet any applicable warranties described in these Terms, you may notify Apple and receive a refund of the purchase price (if any) to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law. Apple will not have any other warranty obligation for the App Store Version. You must comply with the App Store or iTunes Store Terms of Service, including without limitation the LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT in the Apple Terms, which can be found at <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html" class="text-primary" target="_blank">https://www.apple.com/legal/itunes/us/terms.html</a>.<br>
<br>You acknowledge that G&amp;M is solely responsible for handling any claims related to the App Store Version, and not Apple. Any claims related to warranty (if applicable), as well as any losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses resulting from a failure to meet such warranty, will be governed by these Terms. You agree that G&amp;M, and not Apple, is responsible for addressing any claims made by you or any third party regarding the App Store Version, including but not limited to (i) product liability claims; (ii) any claim that the App Store Version does not meet applicable legal or regulatory requirements; and (iii) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation. All such claims will be governed by these Terms and any applicable laws or regulations related to the Services or content provided by G&amp;M.
<br>
<br>In the event of any third party claim that the App Store Version or your use of it infringes on a third party’s intellectual property rights, G&amp;M will be solely responsible for investigating, defending, settling, and discharging such a claim, and not Apple. You represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country subject to a U.S. government embargo, or designated by the U.S. government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
<br>
<br>You agree that, notwithstanding anything in these Terms to the contrary, Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as they apply to the App Store Version.<br><br><strong>[</strong><a href="terms.html#table-of-contents" class="text-danger text-primary"><strong>Scroll To Top</strong></a><strong>]</strong></p>
